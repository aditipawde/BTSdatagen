input	N (number of companies), industry_sectors (list of industry_sectors),

Generate simple attributes (id, location, industry sector, num_owners, emp_base_category, bsr_category, is_tax_haven) 
for N companies

// Employee base geneartion
Genearte category-wise distributon of number of employees with stochastic mean and standard deviation
// RV X (takes mean and std. dev. wrt emp_base category)

SMALL		: e_mu2, e_sigma2 = 200, 50
MEDIUM		: e_mu3, e_sigma3 = 1600, 400

// RV Y (for generating stochastic std. dev. based on X)
Y = N(0.1 * X, 0.01 * X)

// RV Z (for generating emp_base based on X and Y)
Z = N (X, Y) // Choose values of Z based for emp_base category for a company

// Annual revenue generation
Generate category-wise rev/month/employee  

// RV X (takes mean and std. dev. wrt rev/month/employee category)
VERY LOW	: mu1, sigma1 = 20000, 4000
LOW			: mu2, sigma2 = 70000, 14000

// RV Y (for generating stochastic std. dev. based on X)
Y = N(0.1 * X, 0.01 * X)

// RV Z (for generating rev/month/employee based on X and Y)
Z = N (X, Y) // Choose values of Z based for rev/month/employee category for a company

Generate annual_revenue of each company 
annual_revenue = 12 * num_employees * value of Z for a company 

// Net revenue generation
select a company in profit (loss) with probability 0.8 (0.2).
Select percenatge p of profit (loss) uniform(1, 20) (uniform (-1, 20))
net_revenue = annual_revenue * p
